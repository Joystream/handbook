# Marketers Score

## Overview

The marketing working group activities relevant to scoring, will generally fall into one of the following categories:

* **Content Creation:** Creating blog posts, videos, graphics and other content to promote the project, and remixing content which may already exist (e.g. community calls) to be used in marketing campaigns.
* **Research:** Collecting information on the current state of the project and its base of participants, as well as researching other projects in the space as directed by Jsgenesis, the Council, or to facilitate current or future marketing campaigns.

## Content Creation

Content curation is a broad area which might range from monitoring improving listings of the project on DAO aggregator sites or PolkaProject, to designing and writing landing pages for advertising campaigns or creating videos about any aspect of the project.

Another important element of content creation is remixing content which already exists. For example, creating tweets, blog posts and shorter video clips based on community calls.

## Research

A deep understanding of the project and where it fits into the wider crypto space is essential to being able to conduct effective marketing campaigns and produce impactful content.

For this reason, the marketing WG score will place some emphasis on the effectiveness of research activity conducted by the working group. Basically, we are looking for any useful information which will provide useful information for improving marketing activity (or any other aspect of the project).

Research might explore similar projects in the space and compare them to Joystream, or might involve creating surveys to understand our current base of participants. This research may be partially directed by Jsgenesis, but will also rely on the working group defining some of its own questions which research might help to answer.

## HOLD

Due to unclear direction, and high costs for Jsgenessi (in manhours) required for the group the be evaluated, the group will not be incentivezed until this can be addressed.
