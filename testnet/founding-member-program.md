# ðŸ§™ Founding Member Program

## :flag\_us: US persons are not eligible for $JOY :flag\_us:

## Introduction

While Jsgenesis is the team currently building the technology behind the Joystream project, we will not be around forever, and we are instead entrusting the future operation of the Joystream DAO to our community members.

The Founding Member Program (FMP) formally allocates JOY tokens among some of our highest quality community members in recognition of their contributions to the project and ensures that a sufficiently large, effective and motivated community of users is ready to occupy all the different roles required to run, evolve and grow the platform on mainnet.

The program is intended to run _**atleast**_ until the platform is ready to go live on mainnet, possibly even after. However, some changes in structure along the way must be expected.

## Current Founding Members

## Why Become A Founding Member?

* **$JOY:** A share of the native token powering the mainnet blockchain.
* **Membership Status:** A special marker in the membership registry of the genesis block of the mainnet blockchain, forever distinguishing you as an eleete OG-contributor with high social standing. This is very valuable in a governance system which critically uses reputation and standing as a way to give people access to opportunitites, such as serving on a council, or get projects funded through proposals or bounties or to have senior leadership roles in working groups.
* **Handcrafted Avatar:** A unique profile picture, hand crafted in the Joystream brand identity style, making you immediately recognizable on all social media channels and inside Joystream products. Here are some examples

## Stages

There three stages of participation in the FMP

1. **Unverified:** This is the initial status of any newcomer, you can immediately start earning $tJOY and $JOY, however, the moment you reach a certain number of $JOY tokens, you are going to lose all additional $JOY earned until you are verified. **If you re unable to become a FM when mainnet comes around, your $JOY allocation will be lost.**
2. **Verified:** This means you can continue to earn $JOY tokens, increasing your allocation over time, and **you also will lose your allocation if you are not a FM by mainnet.**
3. **Founding Member:** You have become a FM, and any $JOY you have allocated will be accessible to you when the mainnet is launched. You can keep earning $JOY even after this you have reached this status.

## :skull: Bribery

Offering or accepting value, including but not limited to

* cash
* cryptocurrency
* NFTs
* reciprocation of favor in the future
* promotion
* personal favors
* any form of consideration

for access to opportunities, specifically

* A council seat
* A working group lead position
* A worker position
* A bounty

Is not only strictly prohibited, but Jsgenesis will be conducting continuous bribery tests, including recruiting existing members and founding members to help, to ensure bribery does not occur. Anyone found to be involved in bribery will lose their $JOY allocations and be permanently banned.

## Verification

Verification is the process by which Jsgenesis approves you for further participation in the founding member program, so you can keep earning $JOY tokens and eventually reach founding member status. You have to have a minimum number of $JOY tokens before you can get verified: `<add link to dashboard which shares this value>`. To get verified make a thread in the `Verification` category of the forum, using the membership you wish to get verified for, and add a short bullet-point list of things for which you have earned $JOY in past council periods. [Here](http://www.cnn.com) is an example of such a thread. Then finally write an email where you reference this thread, and send it to `verification@jsgenesis.com`.

## Refer A Friend

When creating a membership on-chain, or when interacting with the onboarding process of the HR group ([#onboarding](council-period-scoring/human-resources-score.md#onboarding "mention")), they can select what other member has referred them. **This cannot be updated at a later time, and if there is a conflict between what was told to the HR representative, and the blockchain, then the latter is considered authoritative.** When the new member is verified, the member and whomever referred the member receives `REFERREE_JOY` and `REFERRER_JOY` amount of $JOY, respectively, where these are [#council-period-parameters](testnet-rewards.md#council-period-parameters "mention") from the period in which the invitation was registered. Hence both actors receive a reward.

## Dashboard

There is a dynamic dashboard which holds up to date information on the state of the program and each participant, found [here](https://joystream.retool.com/embedded/public/9478bcc0-f6d6-4f74-bd0a-0637535e75b1).

## History

* **`11/12/2018`**
  * The Joystream project was launched by Jsgenesis ([Blog post](https://blog.joystream.org/jsgenesis/)), JSG was created from inception to focus on the coding and system elements of the platform, while the running of the platform was entrusted to users under the motto [_"We are building Joystream to set it free"_](https://www.jsgenesis.com)
* **`21/12/2018-19/05/2020`**
  * Various testnets were launched over this time period (`Mesopotamia`, `Sparta`, `Athens`, `Acropolis`, `Rome`).
  * All incentives were directly paid in USD (XMR) for work performed on the network. This meant that none of the balances on the testnet were of much consequence.
* **`20/05/2020`**
  * `Constantinople` testnet was launched ([Blog post](https://blog.joystream.org/constantinople-released/)). This for the first time created the concept of `tJOY` and a `fiat pool` allowing for testnet participants to be directly incentivized by tokens on the testnet and have their incentives be impacted by the DAO and community's decisions. The network was initially backed by a pool of `$2500 USD` that was managed by Jsgenesis ([Blog Post](https://blog.joystream.org/constantinople-incentives/)).
    * As of early 2022, the `fiat pool` had increased from the intial `$2500 USD` to over `$65,000 USD`, paying out more than `$93,000 USD` in incentives to users.
  * The `tJOY` balances were exchangeable into `USD` by exchanging them for `Monero` and eventually `Bitcoin Cash`.
  * This release also introduced `KPIs` which were a set of goals for each council to work toward to gain more incentives ([First KPI blog post](https://blog.joystream.org/constantinople-kpis/)).
    * As of early 2022, the potential weekly `KPI` rewards had increased from `$200 USD` to as much as `$4800 USD`.
* **`14/02/2021`**
  * [The `Founding Members` program was launched](https://blog.joystream.org/founding-member-program/). This program offered mainnet tokens to platform participants for the first time, in addition to the more immediate financial incentives available via the incentivized testnet. It was intended for this program to run up until mainnet launch of the project, however in early 2022 it was discontinued in favor of the new system.
    * Participating users were required to produce a document outlining their activity on the testnet which would be graded and given points, and unlike many programs within cryptocurrency projects, only gave actual allocations to those inducted as `Founding Members` (selected by JSG based upon the quality of their participation and contributions over time). You can access [notes from each scoring period](https://github.com/Joystream/founding-members/tree/main/scoring-periods) as well as a list of [`Founding Members`](https://github.com/Joystream/founding-members/tree/main/inducted).
    * Up until this point, no mainnet tokens were offered to users. Regardless of this, a few users had participated heavily beyond the immediate `USD` incentives by producing bots, scripts, documents, driving activity and growth as well contributing feedback, ideas and improvements to the platform. Jsgenesis selected 5 of the most valuable contributors as [`Initial Founding Members`](https://github.com/Joystream/founding-members/blob/main/scoring-periods/1.md) and gave them a generous allocation of mainnet tokens. This was explained further [here](https://github.com/Joystream/founding-members/tree/main/inducted#note-on-initial-founding-members).
    * None of the tokens given to community participants had any value attached. Jsgenesis had recieved investments from various firms however did not disclose any information regarding any valuation of the project.
* **`13/01/2022`**
  * Jsgenesis [announced](https://blog.joystream.org/important-updates-to-incentives-scheme/) the discontinuation of the the `points` system for the Founding Members program.
    * All points were converted into token allocations and given a potential USD value based on the valuation of the project. A deadline of `26/01/2022` was also given for any final reports to be submitted. The `KPI` system was also going to be discontinued upon launch of the new incentives system.
    * The valuation of the project was made public for the first time giving users an opportunity to see for the first time the potential financial value of their contributions so far as well as the potential future rewards available by participating further.
    * Users who were not inducted as `Founding Members` also had all of their points converted into potential token allocations, however they would still be required to contribute more to obtain `FM` status from Jsgenesis.
* **`26/01/2022`**
  * The old `Founding Member` program officially came to an end.
  * With `Olympia` (the largest testnet release to date) and a new `Founding Member` program launching, it would also involve wiping some amount of content from the testnet.
    * Prior to this upgrade, the testnet, incentives, `FM` program, `KPI` system had come together around a nascent, dedicated community and managed to produce a truly staggering amount of activity--including more than 1,400+ on-chain proposals, 3,400+ on-chain memberships, 11,000+ on-chain forum posts, 90+ on-chain forum threads, on-chain elections involving more than `$16,000 USD` worth of stake, more than 85 workers concurrently working on-chain and being paid automatically by a DAO maintained by more than 50 validators. While also sustaining a storage and distribution network sering more than 5,500 video uploads managed by the DAO.

## FAQ

### How many founding members will there be?

There is no explicit target, but one can attempt to work out what a sensible minimum number of highly committed and competent people are required to operate the DAO on mainnet launch usia simple toy model, as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th data-type="number">Estimated #</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Council Member</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing Lead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Marketer</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Human Resources Lead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Human Resources Representativ3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Builders Lead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Builder</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Storage Providers Lead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Storage Providers</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Distributor Lead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Distributor Lead</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Content Curator Lead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Content Curator</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Membership Lead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Membership Evangelist</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Forum Moderator Lead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Forum Moderator</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Gateway Lead</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td>96</td></tr></tbody></table>

Assuming each actor would only occupy a single role, which may not be true - certainly in the infrastructure working groups (storage & distribution), and further assuming we would want to have some redundancy - say `3x` , in founding members to the absolute needed number of actors, as not everyone, this yields an estimate of the number of founding members to be

<mark style="color:green;">**`288`**</mark>

However, this is just an estimate to give some insight into our thinking, we could do well with more or less than this.

### How long will this program last?

Our goal is to keep it going as long as possible until mainnet launch, possible even going beyond mainnet. The only reason to stop it before this time would be to make substantial changes due to some identified problem, or because we have severely exceeded what seems like a feasible total number for the purposes of the program.

### Can I sell my membership?

No, this is strictly against the rules. If it was ever discovered that a membership has been sold at any point, before or after becoming a Founding Member, then this membership would be disabled and kicked out from the program. We will do a final verification before genesis launch where we confirm initial verifications done.

### How much $JOY makes me a Founding Member?

There is no direct relationship between $JOY earned and FM status, howeve the more the better in terms of your prospects. If you are unsure about why you have not yet earned the status, despite a high $JOY allocation, please write `why_not_fm@jsgenesis.com`.

### Can I get kicked out?

Very much so, yes, please read the full ruleset below. Jsgenesis reserved the right to evict anyone from the founding member program, or to deduct or remove their $JOY allocation, including permanently banning them from future participation. Actions such as attempting to attack the integrity of the program, for example by subverting the verification, or by attempting to sell shares of $JOY allocations, will lead to the most severe and immediate sanctions.\

**We will be conducting blind tests to ensure that there is no abuse.**
