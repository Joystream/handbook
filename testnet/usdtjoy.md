# ðŸ’µ $tJOY

## Introduction

This is the native asset of the testnet, it is minted by the testnet blockchain as a reward for various roles, and initial balances can also be obtained for newcomers. It is needed to pay transaction fees and do staking on-chain.

## Value

Jsgenesis had linked the total supply of tJOYs to a corresponding pool of fiat currency (USD) held by the company. All testnet participants can redeem their tJOY for USD at any time. Every council period, some amount of $USD is added to the pool in order to roughly maintain the exchange rate of $tJOY, despite continuous issuance (i.e. dilution) used to fund on-chain expenses, such as validation, rewards, etc. This [dashboard](http://www.joystrem) has up to date information on $tJOY stats.

## Acquiring $tJOY

The easiest way to get your first $tJOY is to either

1. Get in touch with the  [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") on Discord, they are present 24/7: [#feeling-lost](../#feeling-lost "mention")
2. Try to create a membership in [Broken link](broken-reference "mention"), where the faucet will give you some free initial $tJOY. (Only after `Olympia`)
3. Try to create a channel in [Broken link](broken-reference "mention"), where the faucet will give you some free initial $tJOY.

## $tJOY is not $JOY!

Importantly $tJOY balances have no relationship to mainnet $JOY balances, there will be no conversion of any kind.

## Cashout $tJOY to $USD

The $tJOY earned on testnet can be converted into USD, paid out in the crypto currency BCH, with Jsgenesis at an exchange rate which does change, but Jsgenesis attempts to keep quite stable. Learn more about this here. The reason we allow cashing out $tJOY is to allow people to cover some costs of participating in the tesnets, something which does require some time and occasionally some resources.&#x20;
