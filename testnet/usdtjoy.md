# ðŸ’µ $tJOY

## Introduction

This is the native asset of the testnet, it is minted by the testnet blockchain as a reward for various roles, and initial balances can also be obtained for newcomers. It is needed to pay transaction fees and do staking on-chain.

## Value

$tJOY on the testnet does not have any value. However, JSG may choose to directly send BCH to users as a reward for their participation or for running infrastructure.

Previously it was possible to exchange $tJOY for USD via Jsgenesis but this was discontinued in preperation for the impending launch of mainnet.

## Acquiring $tJOY

The easiest way to get your first $tJOY is to either

1. Get in touch with the Integrators on Discord, they are present 24/7: [#feeling-lost](../#feeling-lost "mention")
2. Try to create a membership in [Pioneer](http://dao.joystream.org), where the faucet will give you some free initial $tJOY.
3. Try to create a channel in [Atlas](http://play.joystream.org), where the faucet will give you some free initial $tJOY.

## $tJOY is not $JOY!

Importantly $tJOY balances have no relationship to mainnet $JOY balances, there will be no conversion of any kind.
