# ðŸ›‘ Content Moderation

## Background

Since Joystream has a built in content storage and content delivery layer, it is unavoidable for the system to exercise some control over what content it chooses to service. This is needed not only for economic reasons, but also because out-of-policy content may be unaligned with the social commitment in the community and also in conflict with certain rules to which service providers are subject.

## The Role of Applications

Since Joystream however unbundles the content offering into an infrastructure and an application layers, there is substantially less pressure to impose on global policy about what content is served to end-users compared to a monolithic platform like YouTube, which has to balance a broad range of economic, policy, product and commercial concerns across a single product and enormous user base.

Applications are best suited at exercising and managing very fine grained and detailed policy concerns around moderation and content suitability, by taking into account detailed knowledge about their particular more narrow user base, and users can sort into the product that has the optimal tradeoff of cost, diversity and other values.
