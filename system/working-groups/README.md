# ðŸ‘·â™€ Working Groups

## Introduction

A working group is an organizational body, subject to the oversight of the council, which is responsible for the day-to-day functioning of some subsystem of the platform. There is exactly one working group per subsystem. The rationale for having a working group for this purpose, rather than having the council directly involved, has three parts. First, since all council members are supposed to be fully informed on all matters the cumulative workload of overseeing all subsystems would not be feasible for a single council. Second, even if it was feasible, voting is not a sound means of making such decisions, because there is a lack of guaranteed coherence in the decisions over time. Third, each subsystem will over time likely require a differentiated skill set, knowledge base and social capital. The appropriate analogy for understanding the role of the working groups in the overall operation of the system would be a commission or agency body in a political institution. &#x20;

## Operations Working Groups

Working groups which do not have dedicated on-chain subsystem, such as the content directory or storage system, are called _operations working groups_. They mainly exist to coordinate people are activity purely, and currently we have the following groups of this kind

* Builders
* Human Resources
* Marketers

## Roles

The relevant roles in a working group are

* **Applicant:** A member who has submitted an application to join an opening for a worker role in the working group. A given member may apply more than once to a given opening, and also if they already occupy the role as worker the same group. Openings are created by the lead (see below), or by the council when wanting to fill the lead role.
* **Worker:** A member who has, through an application, entered the working group.The worker may or may not be staked, and is receiving payouts to a designated account at regular intervals. The worker role gives some ability to act in a domain specific way within the given subsystem. So for example in the context of the forum, a worker in the forum working group can be assigned to be a moderator in certain forum categories, and have associated moderation privileges. Lastly, a member may act as multiple works simultaneously, or over time, in the same working group.
* **Lead:** A designated worker who is responsible for hiring and managing the other workers, as well as allocating funds from a budget towards purposes that support the success of the subsystem. Also the leader could set the general working group status, like:
  * a one line status message on the subsystem,
  * new upcoming expected positions,
  * a link to a subsection of the forum devoted to the subsystem,
  * a message feed including information updates.

## Concepts

### Worker

A has the following information associated

* **Id:** A unique non-negative integer identifier.
* **Membership**: The membership to which this role corresponds. Comes from the initial application to the opening by which worker is hired.
* **Role account**: The account currently used to authenticate as this role in the relevant subsystem. Authentication in the working group is done using the controller account of the member, so as to allow for division of labor behind a single membership across multiple roles, while not requiring full trust. Is updatable by member.
* **Staking profile:**
  * **Staking account:** Holds the stake currently associated with the role. .
  * **Leaving unstaking period:** The number of blocks required from a worker initiating leaving the group until their staked funds are unlocked.
*   **Reward account**: The destination account to which periodic rewards are paid out.

    All roles have the following information associated.
* **Reward rate per block:** The number of tokens the worker earns per block, although payouts do not occur per block, but every `REWARD_PAYOUT_PERIOD` blocks. This is earned for every block from being hired to being terminated, or initiating leaving the group. It is not earned during unstaking.
* **Owed reward:** The total reward this worker was not paid over a number of payout periods where there was not sufficient funds in the working group budget.
* **Unstaking status:** Is either _normal_, or _unstaking_. The initial status is the former, and the latter is only entered into when the worker attempts to leave.

### Lead

A designated worker may be identified as the lead at any time, let `current_lead` represent the worker id of this worker when set. It is the role of the council to manage what worker, if any, is the lead in a given working group.

### Budget

The budget is the root resource pool for all token minting in the working group, and the size of the pool is denoted by `budget`. The budget can be increased or reduced by the council. Whenever rewards are paid, or the leader does discretionary spending, it drains the budget, and these events can only take place if the budget allows it. There may be other additional subsystem specific expenditures that depend on the budget, such as minting initial balances for new invited members in the membership system.

### Rewards

All workers are paid every `REWARD_PAYOUT_PERIOD` blocks, and each worker is to be credited according to their own reward rate, and any possibly outstanding owed reward. During this payout, where workers are processed in some consistent order (for a given set of workers), the crediting only occurs while the budget is respected. Also, workers unstaking are ignored. For each payout, the budget is tightened. If a worker cannot be paid out in full, then the difference is added to their owed reward. The budget will then have to be reset by the council. When a worker is terminated, or leaves, any owed reward and outstanding reward from the last payout, are attempted paid out, however if the budget does not allow it, then the worker suffers the loss.

### Spending

In addition to rewards, the lead can spend from this budget for arbitrary purposes, to fund expenses and initiatives that are in line with the purpose of the group.

### Staking

Worker roles require staking in order to apply and remain in the role. Staking for worker roles is done using a designated working group lock on a single account per worker role. The amount required is set by the discretion of the lead. The staking requirement could be decreased by the lead (or by the council for leaders). The worker is able to increase their own stake, for example, in response for leader demand. Consult the [Staking](broken-reference/) article to see a list of other staking purposes, and corresponding locks, which can be combined with staking for a given working group.

#### Staking Policy

A _staking policy_ describes the requirements involved in staking for a role. It has two components, it has an _amount_, the minimum number of tokens required to stake, and a _leaving unstakig period,_ the unstaking period incurred form the time a worker initiates leaving the group.

### Slashing

Slashing is initiated by the council, or the lead, by pure discretion. The full staked amount is at risk of getting slashed, but need not be, and there is no limit to the number of times one may get slashed. Importantly, slashing can also occur while a worker is unbonding. This is of particular importance to avoid a lead attempting to leave the role the moment a slashing proposal is observed. Such last minute exits cannot avoid slashing so long as the unbonding period chosen by the council for the lead, is sufficiently long compared to the inherent delays in the proposal system. There is a similar, but much less severe, concern about workers trying to race with slashing transactions submitted by the lead by attempting to preempt slashing by observing the pool of unconfirmed transactions. The unbonding period required to make this infeasible can be much shorter, essentially just however long is required to have a sufficiently high certainty that the slashing transaction is included in a block.

### Hiring

Hiring is the process by which a worker enters the group. Both normal workers and the lead worker, are hired, in the latter case the council initiates the hiring. Hirings are organized into _openings_, where zero or more _applicants_ may be selected as winners, and becoming workers. An opening for the lead position will always result in hiring at most one worker, and this worker becomes the lead.

#### Application

An application has the following information

* **Id:** A unique immutable non-negative integer identifying an individual application across all openings, is automatically assigned when an application is created.
* **Role account:** A required account that is used to authenticate as the worker if selected, in other parts of the platform. Need not be unique across workers, but in practice probably will be.
* **Staking account:** The account holding the stake of the application.
* **Member:** Identifier of member from which application originates.
* **Description:** [Application description metadata](broken-reference/).

#### Opening

An opening has the following information associated

* **Id:** A unique immutable non-negative integer identifying an individual opening, is automatically assigned when an opening is created.
* **Type:** Whether the opening is for the lead or for a non-lead worker.
* **Description:** [Opening description metadata](broken-reference/).
* **Staking policy:**
  * **Balance:** The required non-zero balance required.
  * **Leaving unstaking period:** The number of blocks required from a worker initiating leaving the group until their staked funds are unlocked.
* **Applications:** All applications created, but not yet withdrawn.

### Status

A working group has an associated _status_ that is updatable by the lead. The status is text signal, denoted by `status`, which follows some yet to be standardized encoding.

## Constants

Hard-coded values are defined _for each working group_, and they can only be altered with a runtime upgrade.
