# ðŸ‘·â™€ Working Groups

## Introduction

A working group is an organizational body, subject to the oversight of the council, which is responsible for the day to day functioning of some subsystem of the platform. There is exactly one working group per subsystem. The rationale for having a working group for this purpose, rather than having the council directly involved, has three parts. First, since all council members are supposed to be fully informed on all matters the cumulative workload of overseeing all subsystems would not be feasible for a single council. Second, even if it was feasible, voting is not a sound means of making such decisions, because there is a lack of guaranteed coherence in the decisions over time. Third, each subsystem will over time likely require a differentiated skill set, knowledge base and social capital. The appropriate analogy for understanding the role of the working groups in the overall operation of the system would be a commission or agency body in a political institution.

## Operations Working Groups

Working groups which do not have dedicated on-chain subsystem, such as the content directory or storge system, are called _operations working groups_. They mainly exist to coordinate people aro activity purely, and currently we have the following groups of this kind

* Builders
* Human Resources
* Marketers

## Leads

A designated worker who is responsible for hiring and managing the other workers, as well as allocating funds from a budget towards purposes that support the success of the subsystem. Also the leader could set the general working group status, like:&#x20;

* a one line status message on the subsystem,
* new upcoming expected positions,
* a link to a subsection of the forum devoted to the subsystem,
* a message feed including information updates.

## Workers

A member who has, through an application, entered the working group.The worker may or may not be staked, and is receiving payouts to a designated account at regular intervals. The worker role gives some ability to act in a domain specific way within the given subsystem. So for example in the context of the forum, a worker in the forum working group can be assigned to be a moderator in certain forum categories, and have associated moderation privileges. Lastly, a member may act as multiple works simultaneously, or over time, in the same working group.

## Budgets

The budget is the root resource pool for all token minting in the working group, and the size of the pool is denoted by `budget`. The budget can be increased or reduced by the council. Whenever rewards are paid, or the leader does discretionary spending, it drains the budget, and these events can only take place if the budget allows it. There may be other additional subsystem specific expenditures that depend on the budget, such as minting initial balances for new invited members in the membership system.
