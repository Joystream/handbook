# ðŸ—ž Forum

## Introduction

[The forum](https://dao.joystream.org/#/forum) is the primary place for community-wide asynchronous written communication about all topics relevant to the platform among members. It is hierarchically organized into a tree of categories, each with designated moderators responsible for policing and encouraging effective and beneficial interactions among members. \
The moderators are part of a designated forum working group, and the lead of that working group can decide what moderators are responsible for what categories. \
Categories contain subcategories, and threaded topic-based discussions, called _threads_, where any member can open a thread, and others can come and make replies in the form of _posts_. Some threads can also include a poll, allowing any member to weight in on a question. \
To create a thread an initial deposit is needed that goes into a thread account, all posts also requires a deposit that goes into the thread account related to the post, whenever a thread is deleted the funds from the thread account are transferred to the caller of the delete extrinsic.

#### Forum Deputy Lead&#x20;

The Forum Deputy Lead is a member helping the Lead with their daily tasks in the forum working group. Beyond the normal obligations, the Deputy Lead can act as a moderator as well.

## Roles

The relevant actors in the forum are

* **Member:** A members participate as normal forum users, creating and responding to threads, participating in polls, and so on.
* **Moderator:** A moderator is assigned to one or more categories. Importantly, when assigned to a category, the moderator can act as a moderator in any descendant category. The root category is an exception where moderator can act, only the lead can moderate. Lastly, a moderator cannot participate in normal forum activities _as a moderator,_ only in distinct moderator activities.
* **Lead:** The forum lead is a member occupying the lead role in the forum working group. Beyond the normal working group lead obligations, the lead can act as a moderator as well, including in the root category.

## Concepts

### Archiving

Both categories and threads can be _archived._ When a category is directly archived, or is an ancestor of a directly archived category, it is considered archived. If not, its considered _active_. If not, its considered active. In either case, being archived prevents normal users from updating any associated forum state, for example through user level interactions like creating threads, creating posts, reacting to posts, etc. However, actions associated with moderators and the lead are still unconstrained.

### Category

Any non-root category is defined by the following

* **Id:** A global unique category identifier, effectively the number of categories created in the forum prior to this one.
* **Parent:** An optional reference to a parent category. When not set, it indicates this is a root level category.
* **Title:** A human-readable category name.
* **Description:** A human-readable description.
* **Stickied Threads**: A list of threads in this category that have been designated as having long-run importance to the category.
* **Subcategories:** The categories with this category as its parent.
* **Threads:** The threads directly contained in this category.
* **Moderators:** The moderator directly assigned to this category.
* **Archival Status:** Whether the category is archived or not. This impacts whether one can use the category, such as creating threads or posts directly, or recursively, within the category.

### Thread

A thread is defined by the following

* **Id:** A global unique thread identifier, effectively the number of threads created in forum prior to this one. From this one can infer a chronological ordering of threads within the category. Importantly, because of the way information is organized in the blockchain state, the identifier for the category is also also required when identifying a thread.
* **Title:** The human readable title.
* **Author:** Member who created the thread.
* **Poll:** An optional poll for the thread, defined by the following
  * **Description:** A human readable description of what question is being polled.
  * **Deadline:** Some block before which is the only time anyone can participate in the poll.
  * **Alternatives:** A list of alternatives, each with its own explainer text, vote count and members who have voted in favor of it.
* **Number of posts:** Number of posts in thread
* **Cleanup Payoff:** Payoff for deleting thread from storage.

### Post

A post in a thread is defined by the following

* **Id:** A global unique post identifier, effectively the number of posts created in the forum prior to this one. From this one can infer a chronological ordering of posts within the thread. Importantly, because of the way information is organized in the blockchain state, the identifiers for the category and thread are also also required when identifying a post.
* **Text:** The post thread
* **Author:** Member who created the pot.
* **Last edited:** Last time the post was modified by the author
* **Cleanup Payoff:** Payoff for deleting thread from storage.

### Editable/Non-Editable

A thread and a post can be either editable or not editable. A non-editable thread/post doesn't take any space in the runtime's storage. When a thread or post is being deleted it just indicates that you no longer want to edit it. To indicate that you want it to be hidden, similar to deletion in a classical forum, you need to set `hidden` to true. The first post in a thread is by default editable as well as any thread at creation. To create a thread or an editable post you require an initial deposit for the usage of storage space. Non-editable posts doesn't require an initial deposit. Furthermore, by deleting a thread/post you can reclaim the initial deposit.

### Reaction

A _reaction_ is a signal a member can send to associate a sentiment, in the form of a non-negative integer called a _reaction value_, with a forum post. Importantly, it is only possible to react, not unreact, that is to withdraw a reaction. The semantics of different values, or of submitting the same value more than once, will require social consensus.

## Constants

The following constants are hard coded into the system, they can only be updated with a runtime upgrade.

| Name                              | Description                                                                                                          | Value     |

| `MAX_POSTS_IN_THREAD`             | <p>Maximum number of posts allowed in any thread for</p><p>any new post.</p>                                         | `fill-in` |

| `MAX_POLL_ALTERNATIVES`           | Upper bound on the number of alternatives in a new poll.                                                             | `fill-in` |
| `MAX_CATEGORY_TREE_DEPTH`         | <p>Maximum category tree depth allowed for any</p><p>new category to be created.</p>                                 | `fill-in` |
| `MAX_NUMBER_OF_WORKERS`           |                                                                                                                      | `fill-in` |
| `BASE_PAY_OFF_FOR_THREAD_CLEANUP` | Base deposit for a thread                                                                                            | `fill-in` |
| `THREAD_DEPOSIT`                  | Base deposit for creating a thread                                                                                   | `fill-in` |
| `POST_DEPOSIT`                    | Base deposit for creating a post                                                                                     | `fill-in` |

Notice that a lot of the limits are forward-looking. In the even to of a runtime upgrade, it may be that the limits are changed in a more restrictive direction, in which case it should not be expected that there is a migration that throws out the storage state, instead, the limit should only be understood to have bearing on future actions.
