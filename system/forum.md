# ðŸ—ž Forum

## Introduction

The forum is the primary place for community-wide asynchronous written communication about all topics relevant to the platform among members. It is hierarchically organized into a tree of categories, each with designated moderators responsible for policing and encouraging effective and beneficial interactions among members. The moderators are part of a designated forum working group, and the lead of that working group can decide what moderators are responsible for what categories. Categories contain subcategories, and threaded topic-based discussions, called _threads_, where any member can open a thread, and others can come and make replies in the form of _posts_. Some threads can also include a poll, allowing any member to weight in on a question. To create a thread an initial deposit is needed that goes into a thread account, all posts also requires a deposit that goes into the thread account related to the post, whenever a thread is deleted the funds from the thread account are transferred to the caller of the delete extrinsic.
