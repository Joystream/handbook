# ðŸ’½ Storage & Bandwidth

## Introduction

The network has a variety of static data assets used in different context. In the content directory, for example, there are avatars and cover images used for channels, and also preview thumbnail images for videos, as well as the video media itself, which may exist in multiple different resolutions and encodings for the same content. In the membership system images are used for the avatar of a user, and there is also a generalized storage capability. There is also a generalised storage service for the benefit of the council and each individual working group, which are intended to be used for storing assets that are of use to actors occupying the given roles over time, or to the platform as a whole.
