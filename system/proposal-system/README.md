# âš– Proposal System

## Introduction

A proposal is a motion to change the state or policy of the system in some way. There are a wide variety of such proposal types, each type having a different

* set of required input parameter values
* requirements and risks of proposing
* barrier for getting accepted
* delay to being put into motion when accepted

The reason for this differentiation across types is because different proposals have very different effects, and carry very different risks of failure or abuse. The proposal system has the responsibility of coordinating the different actors involved in the lifetime of a proposal, from submission to finalization.
