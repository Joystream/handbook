# ðŸ‘« Human Resources

## Introduction

The human resources subsystem is an [#operations-working-groups](working-groups.md#operations-working-groups "mention"), meaning it has no special on-chain features being what basic working group features exist, described in [working-groups.md](working-groups.md "mention"). The best way to understand what substantively goes on in this group is therefore to consult the testnet scoring rules for this group, described here [Broken link](broken-reference "mention").

## Notion Space&#x20;

The community maintains a distinct Notion space which holds more dynamic information on the activities of the HR working group.
