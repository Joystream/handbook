# ðŸ‘« Human Resources

## Introduction

HR group is responsible for the management of Joystreamâ€™s human capital to meet its objectives and improve business performance. Human resource management is necessary for the maintenance of the structural and organizational integrity of Joystream. \
As every other working group, HR group is accountable to the Council and has a set of goals to achieve for each Term. [Human Resources Score](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/human-resources-score) is a quantitative representation of how effective the group is in achieving its goals. \
The human resources subsystem is an [#operations-working-groups](working-groups.md#operations-working-groups "mention"), meaning it has no special on-chain features being what basic working group features exist, described in [working-groups.md](working-groups.md "mention").\
You can see the current openings of Human Resources WG [here](https://dao.joystream.org/#/working-groups/hr). Just click the opening and then Learn More button, and you'll see the details. You can also use this page to see the budget of the group, the number of currently hired workers and information about them, as well as the history of hirings.&#x20;

There are basically 3 roles in HR Working Group: Integrator, Lead and Deputy Lead.

## Integrator

Integrator helps new and existing members get involved in the project and pushes them to become Founding Members. The integrator is aware of the current openings in working groups and tries to find suitable workers for each position. Integrators work with the CRM system. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is a database, which represents the current and history state of the Joystream testnets (you can read more about it [here](https://joystream.gitbook.io/testnet-workspace/testnet/council-period-scoring/human-resources-score#crm)). Integrators collect information about participants and place it to the CRM. They are also responsible for greeting newcomers in Discord, helping them to create a membership, offering them different activities and assisting newcomers in any other ways. \
