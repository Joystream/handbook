# ðŸ›  Builders

## Introduction

The platform runtime, tools, infrastructure software and user facing applications are all meant to evolve over time. A diverse set of contributors are required to facilitate this, including

* **Developers:** Software developers, Data scientists, DevOps and QA
* **Designers:** Web, Mobile, UX/UI, Branding and Visual Design
* **Product Managers:** Digital Product Managers, Product Owners and Analysts

All of these contributors are collectively referred to as Builders. Anyone can contribute in the same mode as any of these possible contributor functions, as all the platform source assets are open source and developed in the open. Being a Builder means that one has some scope of responsibility in ongoing efforts, and that one has some predefined reward scheme associated with this responsibility.\
As every other working group, Builders group is accountable to the Council and has a set of goals to achieve for each Term. [Builders Score](../testnet/council-period-scoring/builders-score.md) is a quantitative representation of how effective the group is in achieving its goals. \
The builders subsystem is an [#operations-working-groups](working-groups.md#operations-working-groups "mention"), meaning it has no special on-chain features being what basic working group features exist, described in [working-groups.md](working-groups.md "mention").\
