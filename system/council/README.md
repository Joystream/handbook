# üèõ Council

## Introduction

The council is a fixed size committee, up for election at regular intervals by token holders, tasked with the role of voting on proposals in the proposal system. At the heart of the governance process on the platform is the proposal system, which allows anyone to submit some suggestion for changing the state or policy of the platform in some way. These proposals are processed and voted on by a council, where the participants are referred to as council members. A seat on the council is won through an election process, and lasts for some period of time until a new election.

## :tada: Jsgenesis Endorsement

While on testnet, and for the purposes of training Founding Members, Jsgenesis will use its token holding on testnet to influence who wins a seat on the council, through the normal election process. A relative newcomer may have a difficult time getting enough votes to win a seat on their own, which is fine on mainnet, but on testnet we are seeking multiple objectives at the same time, hence this sort of intervention is acceptable.

Jsgenesis will, as everyone else, vote on candidates that have announced themselves during the announcement phase of the election process, based on a holistic evaluation of the candidates, the need for newcomers and other constraints. Before the voting period begins, Jsgenesis will announce who, if any, it is endorsing, with how many $tJOY and for what reason. The voting, and the announcement, will be done via the official membership of Jsgenesis, described here [#official-jsgenesis-membership](../../jsgenesis.md#official-jsgenesis-membership "mention") , and the announcement will be in the form of a thread in the forum category `Jsgenesis Testnet Council Endorsements`, [here](https://www.joystream.org), which has the title of the corresponding election ID.
