# üèπ Bounties

## Introduction

The only other way to fund the production of goods that create benefits to a broad set of platform participants is through a financing proposal or discretionary spending by a working group lead out of the group budget. These processes incur the transaction costs of beneficiaries having to convince a number of external decision-makers, such as a council financing quorum, that this is a good idea. For smaller initiatives that ideally should start and finish sooner, or where they depend on knowledge or insight that is not as broadly shared, these processes become too costly.
