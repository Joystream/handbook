# ðŸš€ Marketers

## Introduction

The marketing working group is responsible for promoting the DAO's objectives, projects, and initiatives to the wider community. Leveraging digital channels and content strategies, they craft compelling narratives and create engaging campaigns to attract new members, retain existing ones, and enhance the DAO's brand presence. Additionally, they monitor the effectiveness of their efforts, adjusting their tactics to maximize outreach and foster growth in a decentralized ecosystem.

The marketer subsystem is an [#operations-working-groups](working-groups.md#operations-working-groups "mention"), meaning it has no special on-chain features being what basic working group features exist, described in [working-groups.md](working-groups.md "mention").&#x20;

## Notion Space&#x20;

The community maintains a distinct Notion space which holds more dynamic information on the activities of the marketer working group.
