## Introduction

The applications working group manage and operate video streaming applications and platforms for the organization. These team members work together to create, curate, and distribute multimedia content that aligns with the DAO's goals and values. They also ensure seamless delivery of  video-on-demand services, while fostering partnerships and engaging with community members. This department continuously explores new technologies and opportunities to enhance the DAO's streaming capabilities and user experience.

The applications subsystem is an [#operations-working-groups](working-groups.md#operations-working-groups "mention"), meaning it has no special on-chain features being what basic working group features exist, described in [working-groups.md](working-groups.md "mention").&#x20;

## Notion Space&#x20;

The community maintains a distinct Notion space which holds more dynamic information on the activities of the applications working group.
