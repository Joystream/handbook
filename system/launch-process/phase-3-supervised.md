# 3âƒ£ Phase 3 - Supervised

### Overview

* **Duration:**
  * `unknown`
* **Consensus:**
  * `PoS`
* **Purpose:**
  * Remove the transaction filter, thus opening for "normal" operations and governance.
  * Maintain `sudo` power for potential emergencies
* **Actors:**
  * Jsgenesis (as `sudo`)
  * Everyone
* **Filter:**
  * nothing except:
    * `bounty`
    * ...

### Purpose

Although "no" transactions will be blocked by the filter, the first 8 days of the `Supervised` stage will still be rather limited.

New members can register and anyone can transfer tokens, but nothing interesting can happen before the council is set and Leads are hired. Together, they are required to "open" up:

* proposals
* the forum
* content creation, storage and distribution
* hiring of workers
* etc.

Once election, the council can do whatever they want, but Jsgenesis will retain `sudo` power for the time being.

### Community Actions

Pretty much everything!

The "required" actions are listed below:

* Elect a council
* Establish working groups
  * Set budgets
  * Create openings
  * Hire Leads
    * Storage/content Leads enables content creation
    * Distributor Lead enables content distribution
    * Forum Lead enables the forum
    * Hire Workers

After a couple days, we should be in a place where everyone can participate by creating content, build, host infrastructure and earn a little $JOY before mainnet.

### Jsgenesis Actions

The actions and transactions to be made by Jsgenesis can be found, in sequence, below.

#### Set the `validatorCount`

Although the council will, and shall, take over this role fairly soon, it will take at least 3 councils due to the constitutionality.

In the meantime, Jsgenesis have the option to increase or decrease the number based on the metrics listed for `Thawn`.

#### Move to `Liberated`

Although the exact timeline is not clear, on the `Carthage` network Jsgenesis will make their final transaction with `sudo` before the second council is elected. The only change will be to remove `sudo`, thus giving full control to the council.

Hopefully, nothing else will be required.
