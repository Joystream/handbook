# ðŸ‘« Human Resources

## Introduction

The human resources subsystem is an [#operations-working-groups](../working-groups/#operations-working-groups "mention"), meaning it has no special on-chain features being what basic working group features exist, described in [working-groups](../working-groups/ "mention"). The best way to understand what substantively goes on in this group is therefore to consult the testnet scoring rules for this group, described here [human-resources-score.md](../../testnet/council-period-scoring/human-resources-score.md "mention").

## HR Representative
