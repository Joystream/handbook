## Introduction

A membership is a representation of an actor on the platform, and it exist to serve the following purposes

* **Profile:** A membership has an associated rich profile that includes information that support presenting the actor in a human friendly way in applications, much more so than raw accounts in isolation.
* **Reputation:** Facilitates the consolidation of all activity under one stable identifier, allowing an actor to invest in the reputation of a membership through prolonged participation with good conduct. This gives honest and competent actors a practical way to signal quality, and this quality signal is a key screening parameter allowing entry into more important and sensitive activities. While nothing technically prevents an actor from registering for multiple memberships, the value of doing a range of activities under one membership should be greater than having it fragmented, since reputation, in essence, increases with the length and scope of the history of consistent good conduct.

It's important to be aware that a membership is not an account, but a higher level concept that involves accounts for authentication. The membership subsystem is responsible for storing and managing all memberships on the platform, as well as enabling the creation of new memberships, and the terms under which this may happen.
