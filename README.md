## Introduction

This is the Joystream Handbook, it is intended as a technical document which describes the way the system functions from a technical perspective, and also links to various community resources. For detailed information on how different products and applications work, please consult the relevant tutorials and documentation.

## Lightpaper

This handbook is quite technical and contains a substantial level of detail, hence for anyone attempting to gain a more integrated high level overview of the full project and system, then the [lightpaper](http://www.joystream.org/lightpaper.pdf) is more appropriate.
