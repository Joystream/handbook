## Introduction

This is the Joystream Handbook, it is intended as a reference document which describes the way the system functions from a technical, economic and social perspective, and also links to various community resources. For detailed information or tutorials on how specific software and applications work, please consult the relevant [source repository](http://github.com/joystream/) for the project:&#x20;

## Lightpaper

This handbook is quite technical and contains a substantial level of detail, hence for anyone attempting to gain a more integrated high level overview of the full project and system, then the [lightpaper](http://www.joystream.org/lightpaper.pdf) is more appropriate.
