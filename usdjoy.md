## Introduction

This is the native asset of the Joystream mainnet blockchain when it is launched Q2 2022, the only way to obtain this token at this time is to participate in our [founding-member-program.md](testnet/founding-member-program.md "mention") (FMP).

## Valuation

The valuation of $JOY stands at **$60M USD** as of the last private transactions for mainnet $JOY, subject to vesting schedules which will be announced. We share this information in order to give prospective and future participants in our FMP some baseline for the value of the allocations they are earning.

## Tokenomics

This breakdown is not final, as tokens will keep getting allocated towards FMP all the way leading up to launch.

| Purpose         | Supply    | Liquidity | Vesting |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| FMP\*           | \~8.49%   | 8 %       | 24 m    |
| Team            | 27,53 %   | 8 %       | 24 m    |
| Reserved\*\*    | 21,76 %   | 8 %       | 24 m    |
| Parachain\*\*\* | 10 %      | 100 %     | 0 m     |
| Investors       | \~32,22 % | 79 %      | 12 m    |

\* Counts everyone > 15K $JOY before round 12 as FMâ€¨\
\*\* Additional FM allocations draw from this, and post-mainnet it will be used for a creator program, strategic partners, grants and possibly operations.\
****\*\*\* Funds reserved for a parachain slot auction are to be offered as a reward in crowdloan on relay chain for stakers, which would introduce new, yet to be determined, vesting for crowdloan participants.\
\
To briefly explain the table, for each purpose, the _supply_ refers to the share of the genesis block allocated, the _liquidity_ refers to the share of this share that is unlocked at launch, and vesting refers to the period of time over which the remaining tokens unlock linearly.
