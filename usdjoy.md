# ðŸš€ $JOY

## Introduction

This is the native asset of the Joystream mainnet blockchain.

## Ticker

$JOY

## Supply

The initial total supply is 1,000,000,000 $JOY, however there is no supply cap.

## Hapi Units

The base unit is called _Hapi_, equivalent to Satoshis in Bitcoin. There are ten billion (10,000,000,000) Hapi in each $JOY, and hence at genesis there will be 1,000,000,000x10,000,000,000=10^19 Hapi.
